## About the project
Datasource: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dansbecker/melbourne-housing-snapshot)

In this project, we will use linear regression with the `scikit-learn` and `XGBoost` libraries in Python to predict housing prices in Melbourne. The goal is to predict house prices based on user-provided data.

We will use data cleaning and preprocessing techniques to prepare the data for analysis.

Next, we will use linear regression to model the relationship between house characteristics and its market price. To assess the model's quality, we will use metrics such as RÂ² and MSE.

Finally, we create a web application using Streamlit that can predict the value of a property based on user-provided data. We will analyze the results and understand the project's business vision, which can be useful for real estate professionals, investors, and even individuals looking to buy a home.
